Tags outline the various steps to enable state restoration in iOS apps:

+ `NO_STATE_RESTORATION`: The app without state restoration
+ `STATE_RESTORATION_OPT_IN`: The app generally enables state restoration, but does not implement it yet
+ `RESTORATION_IDENTIFIERS`: The app sets restoration identifiers on view controllers, but the controllers are not restored successfully yet
+ `BASIC_STATE_RESTORATION`: Initially created view controllers are restored successfully
+ `RESTORATION_CLASS`: Non-initial view controllers are restored, too
+ `STATE_ENCODING`: View controllers restore their views' state
+ `SIZE_CLASSES`: The window's size classes are preserved
